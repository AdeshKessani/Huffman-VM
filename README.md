# HuffmanVM

A C++ project implementing Huffman coding with a focus on efficient data compression. The project includes Huffman base and tree structures, a priority heap queue, and supporting test files.

## Features
- Huffman encoding and decoding algorithms
- Custom heap priority queue for efficient operations
- Modular and extensible structure
- Comprehensive testing with Catch2

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++11 or higher support
- Catch2 testing framework (included)

### Building
Compile all `.cpp` files using your preferred build system or IDE.

### Running Tests
Run the included `PP3Test.cpp` file to verify functionality and correctness.

## Project Structure
- `HuffmanBase.hpp`, `HuffmanBase.cpp`: Base classes for Huffman algorithms
- `HuffmanTree.hpp`, `HuffmanTree.cpp`: Tree structures for Huffman coding
- `HeapQueue.hpp`: Custom priority queue implementation
- `PP3Test.cpp`: Test cases to verify core functionality
- `catch.hpp`: Catch2 test framework
